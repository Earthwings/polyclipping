Clipper2 (21 January 2017)
This is just a preview of a major update I'm (slowly) working on. 
This new version currently performs only the "bare bones" of the clipping algorithm. 
It's "bare bones" because there's no merging of polygons that have common/touching edges in the clip solutions.
The merging of adjacent/touching polygons is/was incomplete and cumbersome in the earlier versions and needs to be completely rewritten.
Performance may be very slightly faster than earlier versions.
