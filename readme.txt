Clipper2.
This is just a preview of a major update I'm working on (very slowly). 
So far, this new version only performs the bare bones of the clipping algorithm (ie without any merging of adjacent/touching polygons in clipping solutions).
However performance has improved significantly, and it scales better too (ie as edge numbers increase), when compared to the released (stable) version of Clipper.
